## Introduction

The Titanic dataset provides information about the passengers aboard the Titanic, such as age, gender, class, and whether they survived. This project uses various Python libraries to analyze the data and visualize insights about survival rates based on different features.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **NumPy** - For numerical operations
- **Pandas** - For data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib** - For creating static visualizations
- **Seaborn** - For advanced statistical visualizations

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-eda.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd titanic-eda
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook project1.ipynb
   ```

## Usage

After cloning and setting up the project, you can open the Jupyter Notebook `project1.ipynb` to see the EDA steps. The notebook covers:
- Data cleaning
- Data visualization
- Feature analysis for survival rate
- Basic statistical exploration

### Example Analysis

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
sns.countplot(x='Survived', data=titanic_df)
plt.show()
```

## Results

The EDA reveals insights such as:
- Survival rates were higher for females and passengers in higher classes.
- Younger passengers had a better chance of survival.
- Fare and class played an important role in determining survival chances.
